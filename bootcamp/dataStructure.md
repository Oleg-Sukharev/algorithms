# Data Structures

Ways of organizing information with optimal 'runtime complexity' for adding or removing records

Data structures refer to ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently

# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at one end (rear/enqueue) and removed from the other end (front/dequeue). The element that has been in the queue the longest is the first one to be removed.

# Stack

In JavaScript, a stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. You can implement a stack using an array or a linked list.
